# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Users communicate in real-time with full data sovereignty — no third party ever touches their content, and the community funds its own infrastructure by participating in it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 6 in current phase

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1/6 | 19 min | 19 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 52 v1 requirements following Foundation > Server > P2P > Chat > DMs > Content > Media > Voice dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: Voice (Phase 8) sequenced last despite only depending on Phase 3 — benefits from stable platform, architecturally independent
- [01-01]: Prost module hierarchy must match protobuf package paths (proto::united::{auth,identity,server,ws})
- [01-01]: Shared directory has own package.json for @bufbuild/protobuf type resolution
- [01-01]: Electron rebuild needs explicit --version flag (auto-detection uses system Node)
- [01-01]: Generated TypeScript protobuf files are gitignored (regenerated from buf generate)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: rust-libp2p WebRTC is alpha — server must use WebSocket transport only
- [Research]: sodium-native, better-sqlite3, node-datachannel all need Electron native module rebuild pipeline from day one
- [Research]: libp2p 3.x has breaking changes between minor versions — pin at 3.1.3 and validate API before Phase 3
- [Research]: NAT traversal requires TURN relay for 20-30% of connections — budget as core infrastructure
- [Research]: Gossipsub D=6 default is too high for chat — must tune to D=3-4 for chat topics
