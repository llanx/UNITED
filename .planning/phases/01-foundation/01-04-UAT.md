awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. App Launches Without Errors
expected: Run `npm run dev` from the client/ directory. The Electron window opens without crashes or console errors. The BrowserWindow appears with the renderer content loaded.
result: [pending]

### 2. Build Passes Clean
expected: Run `npm run build` from the client/ directory. It completes with zero errors and zero TypeScript type errors. Output shows main, preload, and renderer all compiled.
result: [pending]

### 3. IPC Bridge Available in Renderer
expected: Open DevTools in the Electron window (Ctrl+Shift+I). In the console, type `window.united`. It should return an object with methods (not undefined). You should see properties like `storage`, `generateIdentity`, `unlockIdentity`, etc.
result: [pending]

### 4. StorageAPI Methods Present
expected: In DevTools console, type `window.united.storage`. It returns an object with methods like `get`, `set`, `delete`, `getAll`, `clear` (the 5 storage methods from the preload bridge).
result: [pending]

### 5. CSP Headers Active
expected: In DevTools console, check the Network tab or try injecting an inline script. Content Security Policy should block inline script execution. Alternatively, check the `<meta>` tag or response headers for CSP directives.
result: [pending]

### 6. SQLite Database Created
expected: After launching the app once, a SQLite database file should exist in the app's user data directory. You can check via DevTools console: `window.united.storage.get('test')` should return null/undefined (not crash), confirming the DB is accessible.
result: [pending]
