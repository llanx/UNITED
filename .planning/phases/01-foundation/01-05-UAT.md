## Tests

### 1. App Launches with Dark Theme
expected: Electron window opens with a dark background (dark gray/charcoal). No white flash on startup. Text and UI elements are light-colored against the dark background.
result: [pending]

### 2. Welcome Screen Display
expected: When no identity exists (first launch or fresh state), the app shows a Welcome page with UNITED branding — logo/title text visible, centered layout, clear call-to-action or onboarding prompt.
result: [pending]

### 3. Triple-Column Layout on Main Page
expected: After navigating past Welcome (if applicable), the main app view shows three columns — narrow ServerRail on the far left (~56px), ChannelSidebar in the middle (~240px), and MainContent filling the remaining space on the right.
result: [pending]

### 4. ServerRail with Server Icons
expected: The ServerRail column displays circular server icons. Each icon shows a 2-letter abbreviation of the server name with a deterministic background color derived from the name. Hovering shows the full server name.
result: [pending]

### 5. ChannelSidebar with Channel List
expected: The ChannelSidebar shows a server name header at the top and a list of channels grouped by category. Each channel shows a # prefix and channel name.
result: [pending]

### 6. Connection Status Indicator
expected: A ConnectionDot is visible somewhere in the UI (likely in the sidebar or bottom bar) showing connection status — colored dot (green for connected, yellow/orange for connecting, red/gray for disconnected).
result: [pending]

### 7. Routing Between Welcome and Main
expected: If the app has no identity, it shows the Welcome page. If identity exists and is unlocked, it shows the main triple-column layout. Navigation between these states works without full page reload (no white flash or URL bar change).
result: [pending]
